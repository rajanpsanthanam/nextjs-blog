**Hey there!**

Canny helps you in tracking feedbacks which in turn helps you in taking informed product decisions.

Tracking feedbacks is one of the key step in product management as it lets you see what can be done on the product.

The best inputs always comes from your consumers. Canny exactly helps you in getting it.

To let you know simply on what this product is about, it helps you in getting feedback about your product by giving you few options like adding widget to your product or public link where people can come and add a post or upvote existing one.

You can then start engaging with users on why would they want it or clarify your assumptions about how people use your product.

Canny themselves use a public link to gather feedback about their product. You can check it [here](https://feedback.canny.io/feature-requests)

It does not stop there, it also helps in forming a roadmap based on the posts created by your users or your team themseleves. It helps in publishing the changelog to the same users who requested it at first place. Seeing the cyclic pattern here ?

collect feedback -> form roadmap -> publish changelog

I am putting down some key factors about canny which I enjoy

**Simple**

Sometimes all you need is a simple product which solves your problem and nothing else. Canny is exactly that. Its help in tracking your product feedbacks and publishing changelog and only that.


**Powerful**

Canny is very powerful in terms of feature set it provides. Right from the widget which you can be embeded into your product to upvoting the posts created by other users. All are key features which gives clear thoughts on why should one be doing the feature or why should one not pick the feature.


**Classic**

I love the user experience provided by the product. You wont struggle using the product, everything is right there where you expect.

One the otherside, there is no free plan. Apart from this, it is a classic product for any product team.
